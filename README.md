Custom Player Models Pill Bugs.
In order to have the player camera height and entitybox changed, you need to have pehkui or some other scaling mod. Also, scaling needs to be enabled on the world or server for it to work "/cpm scaling all enabled [player] <enable>". To not see a regular player hand, you need the First-Person Model mod. This is my first time using github. Here's the wiki for CPM https://github.com/tom5454/CustomPlayerModels/wiki
